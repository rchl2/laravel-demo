## Laravel Orbit 5.4 "work demo" code
⚠️ **Don't try launch this**. It won't work. This is only couple selected parts of application code, let's name it - "demo", that i can show (rest of code is still under NDA).

##  Why?
If you are viewing this and you are tech recruiter/someone from HR - i just wanted to show you some backend code one of the applications i wrote in Laravel 5.x a year ago. There is a lot of things that I would like to rewrite and change, but that is not the purpose of this repository and this application in real scale is not supported till day.
